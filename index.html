<p> <b> Defining an Athletic Director: </b>
</p>
<p> An athletic director is sometimes called an AD. ADs are administrators who supervise and oversee athletic programs at a college, high school or private institution. They are responsible for budgeting, promotion, and scheduling for sports teams. An AD may coordinate with student academic departments, though they rarely work directly with athletes. Instead, they act as athletic managers, organizing transportation, supervising coaches, and guiding sports teams to success indirectly. They are charged with the task of hiring and firing coaches, as well as other athletic staffers in their organization. The following chart gives more information about this career choice.

 <p> <b> Duties of an Athletic Director: </b>
 Your primary duty as an athletic director (AD) is the supervision of coaches, sports teams and athletic departments. Some of your tasks may include initiating fundraising events, allocating money and contacting alumni for donations. You're also responsible for dissolving sports teams, hiring coaches and firing employees. You may also supervise the ordering of equipment and scheduling of events, games and matches. You probably won't work directly with athletes. However, you may act as a representative between athletes and faculty or instructors. 
 </p>
 <h3> <b> Three Key Skills of an A.D: </b> </h3>
 <p> To be successful and survive, an AD has to be organized. He or she must have their procedures in place and know where to find anything related to their position, such as the various rules and regulations, schedules, budget figures, and information on personnel. Their responsibilities are overwhelming and they couldnâ€™t exist without good organizational ability. Their second quality will have to be integrity. There will always be times when they will be called upon to enforce policies that are neither popular nor easy to do but are still the absolute right thing to do. You cannot overstate the importance of giving your word and having everyone be able to count on it, no matter how difficult or painful it may be at the time. Third essential: As an AD you have to be able to communicate well. You will be dealing with coaches, athletes, parents, administrators, teachers, and community members. They will all be different, have varying points of view, and need to understand the expectations of your program. Effective communication means that you also have to listen to the questions and concerns of everyone connected to your program, and you will also have to make explanations, educate, do public speaking, and inform others via the written form.
